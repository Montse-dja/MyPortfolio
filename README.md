# Welcome to my portfolio
Hi! I'm Montserrat Djaddah!
If you wish to see this content in webpage form please head to: https://montse-dja.github.io/MyPortfolio/# (desktop browser highly recommended)

I am an Electronics Engineering student, with an ongoing specialization in Cyber-physical systems. I am currently in my 7th semester, set to graduate in June 2026. I have strong leadership skills, fast problem-solving abilities, academic perseverance, self-management and artistic curiosity. I love learning and growing skills that help me become an all-around engineer.

Feel free to roam around in this repository, but things will look a lot better on the webpage. This is a compilation of some of my projects, my skills and experience. 

If something does not seem like it's working correctly or you found a bug somewhere, please let me know!
