To run the VAD project, one must clone the repo and run the .ipynb locally. 
Microphone access is tricky on web pages and developing a full app was outside
the scope of the prjyect. I hope to someday update this and have a fully

codes on this folder.
This specific code could not be used directly by hosting websites because of some 
non-supported functions on the cloud.
